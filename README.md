##### Challenges :

Overall I don't think there were many challenges with this assignment. Anything I had a problem with was solved by just going through the code and checking the line pointed out by the error message or just fixing typos and making sure that everything was closed off and all the words matched.

The one issue I still haven't figured out is why the images aren't showing. I added padding for the time being while I was working on it to see if there was anything there at all. I'll keep working on it and will update later when I find out why. I have a funny feeling it's the typo that destroyed nasa's rocket again or I'm just adding them wrong, but yeah will check and update code.

##### Take-Aways :

All in all I think today was a bit better than yesterday, I didn't feel as lost because I knew more or less what was happening, why and where so that was great. 

Keeping ol' blue eyes happy and singing is still a bit of a challenge but again, it's all in the typos and it'll take practice to get the hang of it. The road map has been super helpful with breaking things down and going at it one step at the time. Other than that pretty impressed with the progress so far, thought I'd be very lost and confused but everything seems to be going good so far. 

SQL took me back to the bookkeeping and Excel days, which was fun (note the sarcasm). Again I just thing it's a matter of practice for me, the more I do it the better I'll understand it and know the whats and wheres and whys.

I'll give it a 7.5/10
